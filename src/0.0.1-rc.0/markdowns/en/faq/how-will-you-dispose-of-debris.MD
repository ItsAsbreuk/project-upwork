ezhome fully support environmentally sustainable practices. Our gardeners place all organic debris into your green bins to promote reduction of greenhouse emissions, reuse of organic materials and reduction of landfill needs. If you do not have sufficient space in your green bins for fall & winter, we recommend requesting additional green bins from your local waste management company (many offer additional bins at no cost at certain times of year) or purchasing online or from the local hardware store.
