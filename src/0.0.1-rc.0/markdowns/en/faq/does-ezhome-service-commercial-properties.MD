ezhome primarily services residential homes, we would be happy to serve your commercial property if the following 3 conditions are acceptable:

1. Service occurs M-F between 8am-4pm.
2. We use blowers, not sweepers. Keep in mind #1 for any noise concerns during business hours.
3. Property is small enough for us to service with one gardener in 2 hours or less.
