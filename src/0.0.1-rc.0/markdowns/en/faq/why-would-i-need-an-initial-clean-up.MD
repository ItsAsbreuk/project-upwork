If you have had a gap between gardeners or you were unsatisfied with the level of service provided by your previous gardener, your yard will require an Initial Clean-up Service for an additional fee before regular maintenance visits can begin. During an initial clean-up, we dedicate a specialized crew for several hours and focus on pre-determined major problem areas (e.g., excessive weeds and volunteers, extensive growth of plants, build-up debris). Following the clean-up, ezhome maintenance visits over the next couple of months will bring the property to its finished appearance. Our maintenance crews are not equipped to perform clean-ups and they will not be able to create the same impact even over months of service.
