The more information we have about your garden, the better we can serve you. The photos allow us to improve on our preliminary blueprint, catalog the types of plants on your property, and accurately provide quotes of projects as your needs evolve over time. In the end, the purpose of all of this is to provide the highest quality service in the most consistent and seamless way possible.
