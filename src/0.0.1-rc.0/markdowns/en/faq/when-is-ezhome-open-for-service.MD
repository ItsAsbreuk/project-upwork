Except for National holidays, our gardeners work 8 AM - 4 PM Monday through Friday and our main office is open 9 AM - 5 PM Monday through Friday.

As ezhome is committed to our communities, our employees and their families, we observe the following U.S. National Holidays: New Yearâ€™s Day, Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, & Christmas Day. If your normal service day falls on one of these national Holidays, your service will continue, as usual, the following week.

Note that the ezhome service is an annual plan which means that there may be weeks where we will skip service due to it being a holiday. In turn, our services and pricing model are averaged/balanced throughout the entire year with this in mind and in support of our employees and their families.
