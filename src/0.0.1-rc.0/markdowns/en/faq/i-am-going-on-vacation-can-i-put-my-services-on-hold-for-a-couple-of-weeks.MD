Wow, that sounds like a great chance to relax! We strongly encourage allowing us to service your yard on the regular scheduled days and time, as your plants will continue to evolve while you are away. This goes a long way in staying current in your yard and fulfilling our commitments to you. If you cannot continue service due to access reasons, we could not visit with minimum 48 hour notice. However, we are unable to discount your monthly service fees for the hold period, due to the extra work that will be needed to catch up when you return, along with the need to hold your spot on our schedule during your absence.
