Technology improves the customer experience of our gardening service in a variety of ways. First, we are always just an email or call away, making it easy for you to reach us. Second, our service is guided by software from beginning to end so that we track our gardener’s work and never miss a task. In addition, we provide online reports after each service, so you can see “before” and “after” photos, as well as which tasks your gardener has completed, along with your overall project and maintenance history. Lastly, we provide online payments so that you never have to worry about having cash on hand.
