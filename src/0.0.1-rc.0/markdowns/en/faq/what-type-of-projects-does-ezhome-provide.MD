ezhome is primarily a maintenance company, but we do have a team of specialists available for smaller scale projects and yard enhancements. We are happy to discuss the following projects with customers who use our regular maintenance service:

- Tree pruning up to 10’
- Irrigation checks/repairs/upgrades or schedule changes
- Plant disease identification and treatment
- Lawn aeration and overseeding in Spring and Fall
- Installing mulch
- Seasonal flower planting

Please contact us through help@ezhome.com and describe the project you’re interested in. We'll provide a price quote and work with you to schedule the project.  If you are looking for larger scale projects (e.g., lawn conversion, new irrigation system installs, landscape design), let us know what you need, and we’ll do our best to refer you to another provider.
