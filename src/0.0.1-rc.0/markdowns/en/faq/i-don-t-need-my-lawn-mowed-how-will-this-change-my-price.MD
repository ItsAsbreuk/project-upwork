There is no price difference when you do not need the lawn to be mowed. As standard practice, our gardeners blow debris from the surrounding area onto the lawn and "vacuum" it up with the mower because it is more time efficient than blowing into piles and raking. When the lawn is dead or does not need to be mowed, gardeners still do this but with the blade disengaged or on a high setting. So, it costs the same when you choose to not mow.
