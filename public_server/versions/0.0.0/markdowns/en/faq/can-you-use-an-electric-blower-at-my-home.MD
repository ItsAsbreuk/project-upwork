ezHome is a proud supporter of environmental sustainability and remains fully compliant with all local regulations on electric blowers, where applicable. Due to transportation and space limitations, we are only able to offer electric blowers in those cities and municipalities where required. There is significantly more time required to effectively clean with an electric blower vs a gas blower, which would in turn equate to substantial increases to our overall pricing for service to your area. We appreciate your understanding and support of our commitment to providing the highest quality services at the best overall value.
