Your garden LOVES rain. A good, healthy, long drink of water is so good for our gardens and yards! Depending on the intensity and duration of the rain, we do our best to perform as much of service on days of inclement weather, but we do put the safety and health of your lawn and our gardeners first. Here is a list of some of our horticulturist best practices:

Lawns should not be mowed when they are very wet. Based on the duration and intensity of rain, we will skip the mowing of your lawn that week until it is dry enough to not damage the grass.

During heavy rain, out of concern for our gardeners and for your yard, we ask them to not work in your yard. Working with gas or electric blowers as well as the potential dangers of slipping in muddy softscapes is unsafe for our gardeners and your yard.

After heavy rains or in light misting, we ask our gardeners to clean your hardscape with focus on entryway, as well as walk the property to identify (and correct where possible) drainage issues

We will continue work as weather permits throughout the day.

Note that the ezhome service is an annual plan which means that there may be weeks where we can only provide a limited or no-service day due to inclement weather. If you have concerns, your ezhome Account Manager will be happy to speak with you.
