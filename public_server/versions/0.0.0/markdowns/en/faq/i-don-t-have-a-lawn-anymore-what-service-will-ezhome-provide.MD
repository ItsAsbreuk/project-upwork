If you’ve let your lawn die due to the drought, but the sod remains in place, your ezhome gardener will continue to treat for weeds and will also continue to mow the area after blowing leaves onto it (for debris collection purposes). Seasonal rains may also revive your lawn. Because of these factors, your ezhome service outline will not be impacted if your lawn has died but remains in place.

Alternatively, if you have physically removed the sod and replaced it with mulch, gravel, hardscape, or new  landscaping, this may impact your service outline. In this instance, we want to make sure that your blueprint and proposal accurately reflect the current hardscape and softscape layout of your property. Please alert us how we can more accurately reflect your yard’s layout in your blueprint.
