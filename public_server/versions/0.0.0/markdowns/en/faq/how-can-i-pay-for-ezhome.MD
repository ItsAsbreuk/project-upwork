We offer online payments to make both your life and our lives easier. We accept all major credit and debit cards. Checks and other forms of payment are not accepted. We use Stripe as our payments processor to ensure that your information is secure. In fact, we never store your payment information on any of our servers. Stripe is PCI Level I certified, the most stringent level of certification available.
