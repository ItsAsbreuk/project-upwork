To ensure the maximum health and beauty of your garden, we are strong advocates for the horticulture industry standard of the effective use of mulching: typically wood chips or tree bark. Benefits of mulching include: reduces water loss, reduces weed germination, aesthetic appeal; adds soil nutrients as natural bark products break down. To achieve the maximum benefits of mulch, the layer is ideally maintained at 2–3” deep. As mulch breaks down over time, it needs to be replenished every year or every other year. There is a tradeoff between aggressively removing leaf debris from mulched areas and maintaining as much mulch as possible. Fallen leaves is an alternate sustainable option as natural mulch & fertilizer, though it provides a different aesthetic. We at ezhome are very happy to work with you to discuss the best organic mulch solutions for your yard.
