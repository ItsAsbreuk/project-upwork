If you are used to having weekly garden care, we recommend you stay with a Weekly service plan so that your expectations are met. The Bi-Weekly Plan is a basic plan that primarily focuses on lawn care and leaf debris removal. Since your gardener will now be coming every 2 weeks, you should expect double the growth & debris accumulation between visits, so your garden will look less kept between visits. In addition, it will also become more difficult for the gardener to monitor for and report any issues in your garden, such as irrigation issues, plant disease or infestations, etc. If your garden is small and simple with very few/no ornamental plants, a Bi-Weekly service could be an economic option for you.
