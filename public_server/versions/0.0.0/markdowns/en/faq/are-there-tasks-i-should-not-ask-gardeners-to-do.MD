Gardeners lack the equipment and skills to do pest management, electric work, hardscape work, care for water features, and traditional cleaning tasks. To perform such tasks would be in violation of their ezhome work agreement, and may result in endangering both themselves and your property. Similarly, vegetable beds and potted plants have essential care elements and specialized requirements that we are not able to effectively manage with our current weekly or biweekly visit frequency. We are committed to maintaining only the highest quality in the services that we offer and are not able to offer care for vegetable beds or potted plants as a result of this commitment.
