When you request a free proposal, our architects look at publicly available satellite data to create a preliminary blueprint of your property, estimating the square footage of lawn, softscape and hardscape on your property. From this preliminary blueprint, our horticulturalists put together an “Essentials Proposal” for the basic level of our service. Based on additional plant care required in your yard, we can also provide a quote for a “Custom Proposal”.
