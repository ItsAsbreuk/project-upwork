Your ezhome gardener will treat weeds in your flowers beds as part of our Essentials service. If you would like to upgrade your service to include hand-weeding, fertilizing and/or deadheading plants in your flower beds and flower pots, let us know! We cannot hand-water flower pots or care for vegetable beds because these areas need more love and attention than our weekly or bi-weekly visits allow.
