There are some pruning tasks that are beneficial year-round, such as cutting out dead twigs or keeping a branch from hanging into a pathway. Major pruning for most plants is best done in the winter when the plant is dormant. During growth season, minerals and carbohydrates are transferred from the leaves into the permanent, woody structures of the plant for winter storage. For this reason, pruning before leaf fall can affect storage leading to mineral deficiencies and poor bud maturation, which will affect growth the subsequent year. The one exception is stone-fruit trees which are prone to infections, and warmer and drier weather helps to promote faster healing of pruning cuts.
