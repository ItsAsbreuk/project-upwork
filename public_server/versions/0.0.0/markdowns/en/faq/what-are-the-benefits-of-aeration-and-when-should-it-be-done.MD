Aerating is a process done once or twice a year to improve the health and vigor of the grass. Aeration equipment is used to punch holes into the grass (about 1/5” wide and 2-3” long) in order to allow air, water, and nutrients to drain down into the root system. Horticultural best practices recommend aeration in spring and fall. Contact your Account Manager at help@ezhome.com if you are interested in learning more.
