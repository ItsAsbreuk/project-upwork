Installation
------------

## Dependencies

* [node](https://nodejs.org/) 0.12.7
* [npm](http://www.npmjs.com/) 2.14.2
* [bower](http://bower.io/) 1.5.2 or higher
* [grunt-cli](http://gruntjs.com/) 0.1.13

## Development

First, you need install necessary dependencies:

    make

After build the site with:

    make build

The resulting preview site and styles will be in the `dist` directory.

It is recommended that you use the built-in web server to view the site, rather
than open the pages via the file system, because it prevents many problems
with URL resolving. In order to run the web server, use:

    make run

It should automatically reload whenever the source files are chaged.

## Deployment

For publishing new version of `ezh-theme` in our private NPM package you'll
need to,

1. Bump version in `package.json`
2. Commit the change with `git commit`
3. Create new tag with `git tag -a vX.Y.Z`, where `X.Y.Z` is **new** version
   of `ezh-theme` from 1st step
4. Push changes to the repo with `git push` and wait before Circle CI job
   finishes.
5. If Circle CI job ran well, push tag to the repo with `git push --tags`. This
   will add new version of library to the private NPM registry, so you'll able
   to install it in remote project.
